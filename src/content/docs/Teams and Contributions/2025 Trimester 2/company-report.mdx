## Project 1 - OnTrack

### Overview, Goals, and Objectives

OnTrack, also known as Doubtfire, is an innovative Learning Management System (LMS) designed
specifically for skill-based course delivery. This platform enhances the connection between tutors
and students, with a primary focus on Deakin University and other global educational institutions.
OnTrack aims to elevate the educational experience by offering a structured, efficient, and
interactive learning environment. The system is crafted to improve student engagement, boost
learning outcomes, and streamline the teaching and learning process, benefiting both students and
educators.

The OnTrack team is dedicated to continuously improving the platform by working on all planned
deliverables each trimester. While the team strives to complete all objectives, any remaining
deliverables are carried forward, encouraging the next generation of leaders to take ownership and
drive the project forward. This approach ensures the long-term sustainability and evolution of
OnTrack, fostering a culture of responsibility, innovation, and continuous enhancement for the
benefit of future users.

Additionally, our team aims to maintain the quality of our work and improve the usability of OnTrack. 
This includes fixing bugs, improving workflows, and making the platform more accessible for all users. 
For example, we worked on adding colour themes to support students with colour blindness, reducing 
barriers for those users. We also prioritize documentation and transparency. By keeping clear records 
of what’s done, what’s in progress, and what’s next, we make sure new teams can pick up where we left 
off without guessing. We understand that documentation saves time, prevents repeated mistakes, and 
helps the project grow faster.

Other key goals include:

- Responding to feedback – We have a strict peer review process that allows us to learn from each other. 

- Prompoting sustainability – By writing clean, maintainable code and clear handover notes, we keep
  OnTrack stable and ready for future development.

Our objective is simple: leave OnTrack better than we found it and make the next team’s start easier.
