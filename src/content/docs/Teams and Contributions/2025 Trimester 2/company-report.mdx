## Project 2 - SplashKit

### Overview, Goals, and Objectives

SplashKit is an open-source software development framework designed to simplify game and application
developement for beginners and students. It was primarily coded in C++ but has since offer supports
for addition languages such as C#, Python, Pascal, and JavaScript.

SplashKit provides users with a set of pre-built libraries for graphics, sound, input handlindg and
more, making it easier to create interactive applications. It also offers an extensive documentation
and tutorials designed to help students get started quickly and maximise their use of the SDK. This
wealth of resources empowers learners to progress at their own pace and fully explore the
capabilities of SplashKit, making it an invaluable tool for both beginners and more advanced users.

SplashKit will be running with the following projects during T2 2025:

#### **SplashKit Website & Tutorials**

Powered by the Starlight framework, the revamped SplashKit website aims to offer an enriched and
user-friendly experience for developers and learners. The SplashKit Website will also feature
tutorials aimed at helping students learn and explore SplashKit’s functionality. The focus is on
developing smaller, high-quality tutorials across C++, C#, and Python, rather than extensive series.

#### **SplashKit Expansion**

The Expansion team is responsible for maintaining and enhancing the SplashKit core. This includes
bug fixes, feature improvements, units testing, and refining installation and usage workflows
through package creation and addressing installation issues.

#### **SplashKit Online**

SplashKit Online is developing a web-based IDE that allows students to write and run code directly
in their browsers. Initially launched as a prototype in 2023, the 2025 goal is to mature this tool
into a comprehensive product, including further C# support and refining the embedded version for the
SplashKit website.

#### **Arcade Machines**

The university has acquired four arcade machines equipped with Raspberry Pi 3B+ units, designed to
showcase games developed with SplashKit. The short-term goal is to prepare these platforms for
students to display their SplashKit creations. The medium-term goal is to streamline the process for
first-year students to easily upload and test their games.
